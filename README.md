# Riichi Mahjong Score Trainer

## Description

A little program I made to help people practice scoring in Riichi Mahjong. All winning hands are taken from Tenhou logs using the python scripts in [https://github.com/Varantha/Mahjong-LogParser](https://github.com/Varantha/Mahjong-LogParser)

## Disclaimer

Please don't look too closely at the code in this repo, it might hurt your soul. This is my first React project and I have mixed feelings about how well I did.
